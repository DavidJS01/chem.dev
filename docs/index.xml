      <description>Discovering Gleam: Compile Time Type Safety! I recently found this Hackernews post talking about Gleam, a FP language built on the Beam. It seems like Gleam is trying to be the performant, type-safety choice for backend systems.
In the past, I dabbled with Elixir (also on the Beam), and I really liked it! Once I understood the basics of Elixir, it felt like a very ergonomic and productive language.
Types But there is one thing I didn&amp;rsquo;t like about Elixir: the dynamic typing.</description>

      <description>Background I&amp;rsquo;m Learning Functional Programming Lately, I&amp;rsquo;ve started to dip my toes into the fountain of functional programming, and it has been really interesting and awesome!
It feels like a breath of fresh air and more natural compared to typical OOP, and I want to share what I&amp;rsquo;ve learned with you!
Grokking Simplicity To fill in my knowledge gaps on functional programming, I&amp;rsquo;m reading an amazing book by Eric Normand called Grokking Simplicity.</description>

      <title>I Finally Know Why Logging &amp; Monitoring Matters</title>

      <description>Background I am a relatively new engineer. At the time of writing this (August 3rd, 2023), I have 13 months of experience as a data engineering intern, and 6 months of experience as a junior data engineer.
All of my work experience has been in the more software-engineery flavor of data engineering, while my current job is more like &amp;ldquo;Junior software engineer, data&amp;rdquo; in reality.
For my two internships, logging and monitoring was already in place.</description>

      <title>Software Teams Fail and Succeed Together</title>

      <description>A Team-First Focus Brings Everyone Up Most developers work in a team At every developer job I&amp;rsquo;ve had, I was part of a team. Each sprint we worked to achieve a common goal (sometimes multiple goals), even though each person was assigned a different ticket.
No, none of us were some mystical, omniscient software developer that was amazing at devops, software engineering, or system design. We all had strengths and weaknesses balanced against one another.</description>

      <title>Stop Contemplating: Just Start üêß</title>

      <description>Sometimes the effort of planning everything out perfectly is better spent getting your hands dirty and working towards your goals.
My Affiction: Obsessive Planning I recently noticed that whenever I want to do or learn something new that I need to have every aspect of that new endeavour charted out before starting.
I get lost in that pursuit of a perfect, pristine path to begin my journey on that I don&amp;rsquo;t even take the first step.</description>

      <description>Oh no. I sat in my shower and cried for at least 30 minutes after the fact. But, how did I get to that point?
The Situation Background The core of my company is being delivered data files every day from our clients. Most of my work lives in maintaining the application that ingests client data, transforms client data, and then pushes that client data to the client&amp;rsquo;s own production database.</description>
