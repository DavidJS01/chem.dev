      <description>A Team-First Focus Brings Everyone Up Most developers work in a team At every developer job I&amp;rsquo;ve had, I was part of a team. Each sprint we worked to achieve a common goal (sometimes multiple goals), even though each person was assigned a different ticket.

      <description>Oh no. I sat in my shower and cried for at least 30 minutes after the fact. But, how did I get to that point?
The Situation Background The core of my company is being delivered data files every day from our clients. Most of my work lives in maintaining the application that ingests client data, transforms client data, and then pushes that client data to the client&amp;rsquo;s own production database.</description>
