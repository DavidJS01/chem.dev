# Graduated!
This week, I graduated with my Bachelor's in Software Engineering from Western Governors University.

I am the first person in my family to get a bachelor's degree!

# Educational Background
I graduated from high school in 2020 with a completed associate's degree, so getting my bachelor's degree took a little bit longer than the expected 2 years.

But, between finishing my associate's degree and my bachelor's degree, I:
- Lived in 4 states
- Worked 2 internships for 13 months
- Worked a full-time software engineering job
- Got promoted to mid-level

I'm exited to see what the future holds.
