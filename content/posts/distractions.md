What my VS Code setup looks like right now!

![My VSCode Setup](/vscode-setup.png)

This article talks mainly from the lens of using VS Code, but this also applies to my experiences with GoLand and Fleet.

# Prior Experiences in VS Code
In 2021, I learned to program for the first time. Until now, in November 2023, I only used VS Code.

## VS Code is Great
VS Code is great! There are so many features out of the box, the extension-based experience makes it easy to be productive out of the box.

## VS Code is Easy
I piloted VS Code at work for working in production codebases quite often between 2021 and 2023, and VS Code worked just fine. It was easy to get the job done.

It did what I needed it to do out of the box.

# Current Experiences with VS Code

## VS Code is Distracting
I used to use a mixture of VS Code / GoLand at work, Python for the former and Go for the latter.

I find all the buttons, clickable things, the visual noise of icons to be very distracting?

It feels like everything adds up, and so much exists in my view that is taking away from focusing on a problem.

## Difficulty Focusing
This is an issue with me personally. It is sometimes difficult for me to focus, especially when I see a ton of 
colors, pictures, buttons, pop ups, etc in my code editors. 

I think all the visual noise, anything other than the code, brings my attention away from purely focusing on the code.

It feels like my brain is constantly aware of things other than the code (the colors, numbers, buttons, etc).

# What I Use Now: Helix!
[Install Helix](https://docs.helix-editor.com/install.html)

I tried a few different editors like Emacs/Nvim, and both were great! It just felt like I had to spend a ton of time in customizing them
to fit my exact needs. It wasn't fun wading through hundreds of lines of Lua configuration for Nvim.

## Helix is Sane
Helix is pretty great out of the box. It looks nice, it comes mostly batteries-included, and the keybindings out of the box make a lot of sense.

Living solely in the terminal with efficiency from sane keybindings makes focusing on the code very easy. The only thing I see the code and my CLI.


The video below, which can have the quality adjusted to HD, is a simple demonstration of Helix, including file picking, navigating definitions, searching, etc.
