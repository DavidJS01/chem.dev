Sometimes the effort of planning everything out perfectly is better spent getting your hands dirty and working towards your goals. 

## My Affiction: Obsessive Planning
I recently noticed that whenever I want to do or learn something new that I *need* to have every aspect of that new endeavour charted out before starting. 

I get lost in that pursuit of a perfect, pristine path to begin my journey on that I don't even take the first step.

### My Recently Delayed Journeys
Below is a short list of things that I spent *wayyy* too much time planning for in the past two months:

- Do I use modern or classic controls in SF6?
- How do I make my blog look perfect before I even write a post?
- How do I configure nvim on my personal computer to be perfect, flashy, and flush with features I don't use but will totally need in the future?
- What's the optimal learning path for becoming a great software engineer with a focus on data/distributed systems?

In all the above examples, I spent so much time trying to make the perfect decision or creating a perfect plan that I lost time and value from just starting.

## Just Start
If you're like me and get too bogged down by planning and getting everything ‚ú®*just right*‚ú®, just start.

In my personal experience, just taking that first step towards a goal results in traction that compounds upon itself: seeing tangible progress manifesting towards that goal encourages me to keep moving forward and progressing.

## Final Thoughts
Maybe I've spent too much time working on a team that deeply embraces the Agile Manifesto, but I find myself valuing an iterative approach to improvement and learning recently.

I think the concept of "stop contemplating, just start" is especially applicable to the complex subdomains of general software engineering, like (my favorite) distributed systems.

I get the feeling that it will take at least 3x, and maybe even 5x, my expectations of time spent to get good at developing and maintaining distributed systems with high data throughput.

Similar to my general goal, I think we all will be fine if we just start to waddle towards our destination and embrace learning and refinement to our approach along the way.

Just starting, no matter how small, is the highest value effort spent towards achieving your goals.
