# One Must Imagine Sisyphus Happy
I am a huge fan of Albert Camus' work on [Absurdism]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absurdism"). Camus published an essay titled ["The Myth of Sisyphus"]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Myth_of_Sisyphus") in 1942 which observed the tale of Sisyphus. 

Sisyphus was a figure of Greek mythology who was condemned to repeat the task of pushing a boulder up a mountain, only to watch it roll down once the boulder reaches the top. Camus concludes:

> "The struggle itself towards the heights is enough to fill a man's heart. One must imagine Sisyphus happy."

# The Nonstop Effort of Improving Your Craft As A Software Engineer

I recently found a notebook holding notes I took at my first internship. It was amusing to see all the "trivial" struggles I overcame (it was also fun reading my descent into madness) regarding iframes, weird data business domain edge cases, dumb mistakes with the command line, etc. 

I definitely have come a very long way since then, and I feel much more confident as an engineer with every month of experience I gain. Yet, every time I roll the boulder of learning up that mountain, I realize how little I know.

Every time I roll that boulder up that mountain, I realize how much there is to learn, and so begins that cyclical struggle of learning.

It is worth noting that the process of learning varies between software engineers. For some, they only learn at work. I'm very lucky that coding is a big hobby of mine outside of work, so I spend time outside of work reading and trying new things.

Indeed, the effort of becoming the best software engineer that you can be never ends. Putting in some effort regardless will pay dividends; even if just because you enjoy it.
