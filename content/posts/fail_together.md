# A Team-First Focus Brings Everyone Up

## Most developers work in a team 

At every developer job I've had, I was part of a team. Each sprint we worked to achieve a common goal (sometimes multiple goals), even though each person was assigned a different ticket. 

No, none of us were some mystical, omniscient software developer that was amazing at devops, software engineering, or system design. We all had strengths and weaknesses balanced against one another.

Because we work in teams consisting of a diverse technical background, we are able to succeed and meet large goals by pooling together our efforts and resources. 

## Why you should adopt or continue a team-first perspective


### The selfish reasons

#### It probably makes your boss happy :)
If your boss is the engineering manager for your team, it's likely that he or she cares greatly about the team's ability to execute against those common goals.

Aligning your efforts to help your engineering manager reach their goal is an amazing way to get absolute support from them. Helping your boss reach their goals, and helping those around you reach their goals, has a profound impact on your career trajectory.

Ultimately, your manager's perception of you is the primary determinant during performance review time.

Being known as an enabler of your fellow team members is very valuable.

### The selfless reasons

#### Enabling team members is intrinsically rewarding
Uplifting others to be the best version of themselves is one of the most satisfying and fulfilling things you can do.

The vast majority of people just need a little help or guidance to tap into their potential and thrive. 

Something just makes me feel so warm and happy inside when I see the compounding return of providing a little help: someone stepping towards becoming their best version of themselves with confidence.

#### A collaborative culture is infectious

At my current company, a culture of "I'm here to work independently, heads-down coding" permeates. We aren't a tiny startup anymore, but that culture still sticks around, despite the fact that we transitioned to a more typical and mature approach to software development. 

Now, we go through a typical develop -> code/peer review -> QA testing -> UAT development process. 

I noticed that when I go out of my way to code review and perform QA testing on my coworkers' tickets, they are much more inclined to put in the effort to help another developer's ticket get to the finish line.

In my team, as collaboration improved, velocity improved.

#### When a team delivers, everyone benefits

When a team delivers and succeeds as one cohesive unit, everyone benefits. Your manager achieves their goals, and both you and your coworkers improve as engineers or learn something new.

## Closing Thoughts

With a team-first perspective, every person on the team benefits. Your manager has a collaborative, effective team, and both you and your coworkers iterate and improve as engineers and communicators over time. 

Even if your team is struggling with abandoning an old, non-collaborative culture, simply putting in the effort to spread the idea that we all fail and succeed together goes a long way. 

That effort, no matter how small, spreads the seeds of an environment where team members can thrive and grow to meet their potential. With that effort, that growth-orientated environment takes root.

Even if those roots result in only a small change towards a team-first environment, at the very least you can come out of your experience at your job knowing that you did good onto your world.

At the very least, you can know that you helped someone improve and become a better version of themselves - and even helping one person grow is an intrinsically fulfilling reward.

At the very least, you left your team in a better place than you found it.
