I only encountered impostor syndrome two times in my life, so far. My first experience with impostor syndrome was when I was enrolled in [NWFSC's Collegiate High School](https://chs.nwfsc.edu/). 

My local community college founded a high school, believing that, with the proper support, high school students could succeed in college courses full time and gradudate with both their Associate of Arts and high school diploma.

One day, I had a visceral, uncomfortable feeling in my stomach: "why am I here?" Something about me attending the school felt so wrong. 

## Environment and Upbringing

The interactions and experiences you have both in your daily environment and your upbringing subtly influences implicit beliefs about yourself. Information you consume does, over time, seep into your core beliefs.

Because of this, it is imperative to critically reflect on information you consume and interactions with others.

### School
Coming from a familial background of only high school diplomas and many family members struggling financially, internally it felt like I was out of place among the other students.

It was really strange to see two siblings from my school shop for designer handbags during our class. Considering my background, did I really belong with people like this?

### Work
Before my first junior data engineering position for Atlas Health, I had 13 months of experience at two long term data engineering internships.

By the time I started my second internship, I was fully comfortable working independently and completed sprint work at the same cadence as the junior data engineers on the team. 

Despite that, an engineer on the team I collaborated with extensively consistently made backhanded comments on my work, often jumping to conclusions without understanding why I implemented something a certain way. 

Those constant, yet small, negative interactions with them made me question my validity as an engineer.

## Outcomes
I knew I was capable, and I knew rationally that I was not an impostor even though I felt like one. I decided to stick it out.

I was the first person in my family to obtain an Associate's degree. I even graduated from my local community college weeks before high school.
