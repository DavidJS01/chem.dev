## SmallTalk
I went on a bit of an adventure recently, trying to get down to the roots of OOP.

SmallTalk was not the first OO language, but an influential article was published in a 1981 in Byte Magazine introducing OOP to a wider audience.

I actually bought the magazine from ebay, and it is so cool :)

I found that the proposed idea of OOP in the article is not exactly what it is today, and the original vision probably most closely aligns with Erlang :).
