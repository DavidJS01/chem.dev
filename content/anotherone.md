> Many thanks to my wonderful project managers, direct managers, and team members who made my experience awesome <3

## Background
I joined a small, series A startup company with decent funding, primarily working as a data platform engineer.

Towards the last half of my time at the job, I transitioned to more of a data-orientated backend developer role,
working in Go.

### Progress
I was hired for a junior role, but after about 8 months I was promoted to a mid-level role.

I came into the role with ~13 months of data engineering internship experience, working independently with minimal help, so I was not suprised.

### Impressions, Wishes
Overall, the role's technical requirements felt very easy and doable, and only a couple of times I felt challenged with software development.

I wish I got more exposure to system design.

Likewise, I wish technical leadership on my team was not kept on "ivory tower architect"
mode 24/7, so I could get more feedback. It was only like this because of management choices.

# What I Learned
- Temporary solutions seem to be the most permanent
- The primary system was built with temporary solutions, glue, and duct tape, resulting in a black box.
  - Could have been avoided with general thought and the appropriate dev. culture.
- Good project managers are amazing!!!
- Think carefully and confirm any assumptions with coworkers - assumptions can lead to painful results.
- Being kind and genuinely caring to coworkers can transform your team's morale.
- Being a kind, uplifting coworker and meeting the technical skill requirements is a great combo for success.
- I learned so much from my direct managers :)

# What Went Well
- Before I burned out, I significantly improved the team's culture just by being kind and caring about my team
- I had an amazing manager for some time that advocated for my promotion :D
- I had the best project managers and working with them was a joy <3
- I navigated a black-box codebase with some effort and identified critical issues.
- Very easily contributed to the codebase, coding felt pretty easy overall and I felt very comfortable.
- Created a really cool feature of reading configuration from a yaml file with many configuration fields
and adjusting the pipeline's output at runtime.

# What Didn't Go So Well
- Very little trust or guidance from SRE team to implement IAC or touch infrastructure. Some IAC, but for an unused system.
  - Felt bad to not be able to do this rather than being properly staffed with SRE oversight.
- Constant shuffling of management - how exhausting!
- Felt really bad seeing team culture crumble as everyone got burned out. Expectation management was not that good.
- I could have communicated more clearly and better.
- Little senior guidance. At most one senior on my team at a time, and the best code reviews came from the VP of Engineering.

# TL;DR:
My career took a big step forward at my role, and I loved my coworkers.

I navigated some **questionable** code in our big Python codebase with not too much struggle. Now I know what not to do!

I hope my next job gives me an environment with more input on system design, better access to IAC, and more senior engineer bandwidth for code reviews.
